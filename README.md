Project Overview
Name: Hospital Management System
Technology Stack: Java, MySQL, JDBC, Scanner (for user input)
Purpose: To manage patients, doctors, appointments, and provide a user-friendly interface for hospital staff to streamline operations.

Key Features.....................
User Roles:

Doctors: Can view their details, check appointment history, and manage their schedules.
Patients: Can be added, viewed, and deleted, with appointments booked against them.
Database Management:

MySQL is used to manage the database with tables for patients, doctors, and appointments.
Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity (e.g., appointments reference existing patients and doctors).
CRUD Operations:

Create: Adding new patients and doctors through the system.
Read: Viewing lists of patients and doctors, along with their details.
Update: Updating patient and doctor information as needed (not directly shown but can be implemented).
Delete: Removing patients from the system, ensuring constraints are respected.
Appointment Management:

Users can book appointments by checking the availability of doctors on specific dates.
Appointment history can be viewed for each doctor, showing past patients and times.
Technical Implementation
Database Schema:

Patients Table: Contains fields like patient_id, first_name, last_name, etc.
Doctors Table: Similar structure with additional fields for specialty and experience.
Appointments Table: Links patients to doctors and includes date and time of the appointment.
JDBC Connection:

A connection to the MySQL database is established using JDBC.
Prepared statements are used for executing SQL queries safely, preventing SQL injection.
Menu-Driven Interface:

A console-based interface allows users to select options for managing patients, viewing doctors, and booking appointments.
Input is handled using Scanner, and user input is validated.
Error Handling:

SQL exceptions are caught and logged to ensure the application can provide meaningful feedback to the user.
Foreign key constraints are respected to prevent deletion of patients with existing appointments.
Challenges Faced
Managing foreign key constraints during the deletion of patients.
Ensuring the application handles exceptions gracefully, providing users with clear messages about what went wrong.
Designing the database schema to effectively represent the relationships between patients, doctors, and appointments.
Future Enhancements
Implementing a GUI using Java Swing for a more user-friendly experience.
Adding authentication to differentiate between user roles (e.g., doctors, nurses, admin).
Expanding the system to include features like billing, patient history, and prescriptions.
